This is great! Thou I think this should be implemented directly by the packages that use the Handlebars runtime. I'm doing that for [hbsfy](https://github.com/epeli/node-hbsfy). It's much better that way because then the actual package using the Handlebars runtime can decide which version to use.

The hbsfy package was the reason why I created handlebars-runtime. This means that this package is now obsolete for me and I won't be no longer maintaining this. Although I see that there are few other packages on npm that depend on this:

https://npmjs.org/package/handlebars-runtime

If anyone wants to maintain this package I can give npm and github access rights.

The runtime access in hbsfy is implemented like here:
